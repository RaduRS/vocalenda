Is there anything important the AI should tell customers? (e.g., parking, specific policies).

Example: "Please note that we are cash-only," "Free parking is available at the rear of the building."

Customer Notes / Special Requests

[✓] Allow customers to add a special request or note to their booking.

This will enable the AI to ask "Is there anything else you'd like to add to the booking?" and record the response, like "I'd like a coffee ready for me."

Booking & Cancellation Policy Agreement (MVP)

Please review and agree to the following MVP booking rules:

[✓] AI Authority to Book: I understand that the Vocalenda AI will book appointments directly into the calendar.

[✓] Human Responsibility: If our business cannot honor a booking made by the AI, I understand that it is our responsibility to contact the customer directly to reschedule.

[✓] No Cancellation Fees: I understand that for the MVP, no cancellation fees will be mentioned or applied to customers.

By collecting these specific data points, you ensure that the AI agent for each business is not only functional but also personalized, leading to a much better experience for both the business owner and their customers.
